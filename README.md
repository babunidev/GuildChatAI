# GuildChatAI

**Author:** Babuni.dev

A guild-chat capture and manual-send experiment for WoW. It stores received guild messages and roster names, and `/gcai <message>` forwards supplied text to guild chat. There is no demonstrated real AI integration: no model request, response generation, external bridge, credentials, or automatic reply loop exists in the inspected source.

## Installation and use

Install `GuildChatAI.toc` and `GuildChatAI.lua` directly under `Interface/AddOns/GuildChatAI/`, restart the client and enable the addon. The manifest targets interface 11200, but compatibility is unverified.

`/gcai hello` attempts to send `hello` to GUILD. It does not ask an AI to compose it. Empty input prints usage. Received guild messages are appended to `GuildChatAIDB.guildMessages`; roster names are stored in `guildRoster`. Chat history and player names are retained locally; no export or deletion UI is implemented.

## Limitations and verification

- Validate Lua syntax, addon varargs and callback argument conventions against the intended 1.12 client; interface 11200 alone does not establish compatibility.
- Check `%f` timestamp handling, saved-variable initialization timing and malformed existing DB tables.
- Check whether calling `GuildRoster()` inside its update event causes repeated requests/events.
- Verify guild membership and send failures; the command prints confirmation after requesting a send, without delivery acknowledgement.
- Decide retention and clearing behavior before extended use; storage grows without a bound and printed text does not ensure disk chat logging.

## Evidence and status

Reviewed on 2026-10-26 against `main` at [c66af0e](https://github.com/babunidev/GuildChatAI/commit/c66af0eb34e76dd00ee077a8f41fbbc55f4b5523). Current Lua, TOC, README and dated commit history were inspected. Source describes implementation; it does not establish successful operation. Historical intent is reconstructed only where labeled. No in-client test or automated test was executed during this documentation pass.
